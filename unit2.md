# Unit 2: Building Agents with LangGraph

In the previous unit, we covered the basics of LangGraph, including state management, nodes, and edges. We built a simple chatbot with memory and conditional routing. [cite: 1061, 1062, 1063, 1098, 1099, 1100, 1101] Now, let's take it a step further and explore how to build more complex and capable agents using LangGraph.

**What is an Agent anyway?**

In the world of LLMs, an agent is an LLM (or a combination of LLMs and other systems) that can take actions to accomplish a task. [cite: 1130, 1131] This is in comparison to a basic "Q&A bot", which is only capable of answering questions directly using its knowledge and "reasoning" capabilities. [cite: 1143, 1144] An agent can take actions to accomplish a task, which not only includes using tools (such as search engines) but also interacting with the real world. [cite: 1418, 1419, 1420, 1421]

**Why Should I Use LangGraph to Build an Agent?**

LangGraph offers several benefits for building LLM agents:

*   It allows for easy integration of tools into your agent workflows.
*   It provides a structured approach to manage the agent's state and actions.
*   It supports building complex agents with multiple tools and decision points.
*   It enables parallel execution of tools, speeding up task completion.
*   It provides mechanisms to handle tool errors and retry failed calls.

**Key Concepts**

Before we start building agents, let's review some important concepts:

*   **Tools:** These are the external systems or APIs that your agent can use to gather information or take actions. Examples include search engines, web scrapers, calculators, and more.
*   **Tool Integration:** This is the process of connecting your agent to external tools, allowing it to call them when needed.
*   **Tool Calling:** This is the act of the agent invoking a tool with specific arguments.
*   **Tool Validation:** This is the process of ensuring that the tool arguments provided by the agent are valid and conform to the tool's API.
*   **Parallel Execution:** This is the ability to execute multiple tools simultaneously, improving the agent's efficiency.
*   **Error Handling:** This involves managing tool failures, retrying failed calls, and providing informative error messages to the user.

**Let's Get Building**

In the exercises for this unit, you'll learn how to:

*   Build a simple agent that can use a search tool [Tool Integration]
*   Create a multi-tool agent that can select the appropriate tool for a task [Tool Calling and Validation]
*   Implement parallel execution of tools to speed up task completion [Parallel Execution]
*   Handle tool errors and retry failed calls gracefully [Error Handling]

By the end of this unit, you'll be able to build powerful LLM agents that can effectively use tools to accomplish a wide range of tasks. Let's continue our LangGraph journey!
